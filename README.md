# Project Title
 "Predicting Race and Socioeconomic Characteristics from Police Shooting Data"
 
 This project is a part of the ADS-502 Applied Data Mining course in the Applied Data Science Program at the University of San Diego. 
 

## Project Introduction / Objective:
Applied Data Mining Final Project for USD MS-ADS where police shooting data since 2015, along with other socioeconomic data was collected to develop an analytics base table for use in predicting race of police shooting victims.
